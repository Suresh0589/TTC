	 <p>Cancellation<br />
 <br />
We have two main formats of providing services to you and our cancellation policy accordingly differ by formats chosen: <br />
 <br />
Immediate help: Where the customer immediately gets therapy and counselling session with chosen available therapist.</p>

<p>Booking an appointment: Where the customer books a therapist/counsellor for a later date and/or time. <br />
 <br />
Immediate help <br />
 <br />
No Cancellations can be made as the process and format of therapy/counselling is instant. Immediately after payment, the online therapy session begins on the same page for user.<br />
 <br />
Later Appointment <br />
 <br />
Cancellations can be made at-least 12 hours prior to your appointment with the Therapist/Counselor. You just need to go to My appointments in your Patient Dashboard and click cancel button placed next to your current appointment. Full money will be returned in your account within 15 business days. <br />
 <br />
 If you wish to cancel or change the date of one or more sessions within the package, you can do this by emailing us.<br />
 <br />
Refund and Rebooking Policy <br />
(same for both Immediate Help and Later/Book an Appointment)<br />
 <br />
An unlikely case of therapist not being available at the time of appointment<br />
 1). If you have paid for a therapists' service and for some reason, the therapist is not available to provide you therapy and counselling service instantly or later, you are entitled to rebook the same therapist or another therapist of the same price for some other time later. If this option is not suitable for you, you can also get a complete refund. <br />
 <br />
In case of technical failure from the therapist/counselor's end <br />
2a). For disconnections occurring when less than 40% of therapy session time was remaining, the user is entitled to book the same therapist for the remainder minutes instantly or for a later time considering therapist's next availability. As soon as the session gets disconnected, you can call us on our number or directly try to rebook.</p>

<p> 2b). We offer a complete free therapy session for the same session time as customer's booked session, if there is a technical failure from the therapist/counsellors end, leading to abrupt ending of the session when less than 50% of the session time was remaining. <br />
 <br />
2c). We offer a choice for full refund or a complete free therapy session if there is a technical failure from the therapist/counsellor's end leading to abrupt ending of the session when more than 50% session time was remaining. <br />
 <br />
In extremely unlikely case of ill-behavior by the therapist/counselor<br />
3). Extremely unlikely that this happens but as a policy we offer full refund in case, the therapist has misbehaved and/or abused user in any manner. Upon receiving your complaint we will have to procedurally check, chat or video/audio records to make sure that an ill incident/behaviour happened on the behalf of therapist. If the therapist had displayed any questionable behaviour, your full refund will be processed and will reflect in your account/card between 7-15 business days. <br />
 <br />
In case of technical failure from user' end :<br />
4). For disconnections occurring when 50% or more of therapy session time is remaining, the user can book again by paying 20% of the remaining session's price</p>

<p>For disconnections occurring less than 50% or more of therapy session time is remaining, the user has to book again by paying the complete price. <br />
